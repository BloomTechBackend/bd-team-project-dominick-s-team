# [Your Name] - [Team name] Accomplishment Tracking

Each team member should have their own version of this document.

## Background

It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE
career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in
handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

## Instructions

**Save a copy of this document in your “private” folder.**

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during
the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This
should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills
laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

* Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices
* Writes secure, testable, maintainable code
* Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and
  algorithms
* Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality
* Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics
* Contributes to planning and design
* Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks

The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but
should include things like key CRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

_You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your
instructors by the end of the unit._

## Week 1

**Goals:**
1. write a design document for the app i would like to build
2. begin building out the app with unit testing



**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:
committed the first round of code to meet goals for the week


**Things learned:**
I learned how to use trello to more accuratley plan the steps of a big project
I learned how each element of an application works with the others and how one small thing wrong with the organization can break everything

## Week 2

**Goals:**
1. create corresponding stacks for the data that i want to access and store in DynamoDbTables
2. Troubleshoot functionality and add more tests

**Activity:**
I created stack and found that the intialization was failing so i read up on that
once I got that to work I ran into a failure to unmarshall request error which i believe is in correlation with the permissions of aws and i will need help to fix it. all test pass locally


**Things learned:**
I learned that even when code works locally it is important that the other parts of a program i.e. stacks are given correct permissions or the application wont work anyway
## Week 3

**Goals:**
1. learn html, javascript and other front end design languages in order to create a user interface 
**Activity:**
I created a simple user interface so that I could access the data stored to get recipes
2. I prepared the functionality to create grocery lists although i will wait to implement it until later

**Things learned:**
how to type in JS as well as HTML and use CSS to design user interfaces

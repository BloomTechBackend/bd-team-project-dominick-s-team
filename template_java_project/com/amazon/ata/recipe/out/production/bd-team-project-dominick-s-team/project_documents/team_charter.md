### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
    *E.g., Be open to opinions that differ from your own, actively ask for
    opinions from each member of the team, do not interrupt each other, don’t
    place blame, all suggestions or questions are encouraged, listened to,
    considered equally, and never judged*

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
    *E.g., communicate when there is a misunderstanding, don’t move forward
    until the situation is resolved, directly address and resolve negativity,
    give and receive feedback with a positive, strength-building mindset, if
    necessary, escalate to a BloomTech staff member*  

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
     *E.g., estimate task size, break down large tasks, call out tasks at risk
     early, ask each other for help, how to ensure timely code reviews, how to
     share knowledge, help each other hold accountability give frequent,
     scheduled updates*  

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
     *E.g., acknowledge, but don’t punish slipped dates, figure out what went
     wrong, identify lessons for future*

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
     *E.g., where to track goals and when to review them, use definitive,
     quantifiable terminology, include clear background on why this goal is
     necessary, include “done” criteria for the goal (code is pushed with
     integration tests, document is reviewed, etc.)*
